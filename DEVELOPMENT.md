# Developing the IM Operator

## Prerequisites

To build this project, you will need the following:

1. Go 1.16 or greater
1. [operator-sdk](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/)
1. A container CLI like [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/)


## Build Dependencies

The [Makefile](./Makefile) is structured such that other dependencies of this project are obtained as they are needed by
running `go install` or `curl` to download and install these dependencies to the `bin` directory of this project. The
versions of these dependencies are pinned via defaulted variables within the Makefile. If you would like to run with
different versions of these dependencies, install them to this project's `bin` directory and `export` the variables
associated with each custom version. These variables are as follows:

- kustomize:
  - `KUSTOMIZE`: path to kustomize binary
  - `KUSTOMIZE_VERSION`: version of kustomize installed
- yq:
  - `YQ`: path to yq binary
  - `YQ_VERSION`: version of yq installed
- controller-gen:
  - `CONTROLLER_GEN`: path to controller-gen binary
  - `CONTROLLER_TOOLS_VERSION`: version of controller-gen installed
- Go:
  - `GO_VERSION`: version of go installed

## Building Artifacts

### Environment Variables

These environment variables impact the resulting build artifacts and can be changed to affect the output of the build:

- `IMG`: The base name of the Operator image
- `REGISTRY`: The registry namespace; used for Operator image builds
- `IMAGE_TAG_BASE`: The registry namespace and part of the image name; used for
  Operator bundle image builds
- `GIT_COMMIT_ID`: The short commit SHA for the HEAD of the current branch; used
  for image labels and single-arch image tags 
- `GIT_REMOTE_URL`: The URL of the git remote for this project; used for image labels
- `CONTAINER_CLI`: The container tool for builds and other image-related activities
- `VERSION`: The version of the Operator; used for the bundle image, multi-arch
  manifest, and catalog image tags
- `BUILD_LOCALLY`: Skips pushing the images when set to "1" for targets where
  Operator images are built
- `MODE`: When set to `"dev"`, runs bundle-related targets using
  development-only copies of overlays and Dockerfiles

### Operator Binary

Running `make build` builds the Operator binary for the host OS and architecture.

### Operator Images

#### Single-Arch Images

To build an Operator image for a single architecture only, run one of the following:

* For amd64:

    ```sh
    make build-image-amd64
    ```

* For ppc64le:

    ```sh
    make build-image-ppc64le
    ```

* For s390x:

    ```sh
    make build-image-s390x
    ```

#### Multi-Arch Images

To build an Operator image for each architecture as well as a multi-arch manifest, run the following target:

```sh
make images
```

### Operator Bundles

The Operator bundle is generated by using a variety of tools to create and fill
out the templates in [the config directory](./config). To generate the Operator
bundle based upon the configuration and code present, run the following:

```sh
make bundle
```

#### Bundle Development Targets

In order to allow for development-only changes to the kustomizations and config
without touching the prod kustomization overlays, you can generate a new set of
development-only overlays by running the following:

```sh
make dev-overlays
```

This `make` target will copy the contents of the `prod` overlays into new set of
`dev` overlay directories. A common use case is updating the Operand images to
point to pre-prod references; this can be achieved by editing 
[the image_env_vars_patch.yaml](./config/manager/overlays/dev/image_env_vars_patch.yaml)
to use whichever images references you want for the Operands.

Once all of the desired changes have been made, you can create a new Operator
bundle using the `dev` overlays by running the following:

```sh
MODE=dev make bundle
```

When running the above `make` target, it will also replace the Operator image
reference in the manager manifest with `${IMAGE_TAG_BASE}:${VERSION}`. These
variables default to the production registry reference and latest Operator
version tag respectively, but setting these variables allows you to build and
push Operator images to different registries and image tags. Note that these
variables are used for other `make` targets as well and can affect their output;
see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more.

Finally, to build a `dev` bundle image, run the following target:

```sh
MODE=dev make bundle-build
```

## Updating the Project's Version

To set the version of the project to a new SemVer, run the following:

```sh
# NEW_VERSION is the desired SemVer to set across source and artifacts, e.g. 4.6.0
VERSION="${NEW_VERSION:-}" make update-version
```

This will update all image tags, the production kustomize overlays, and the
version set in [version.go](./version/version.go) with the SemVer value of
`VERSION`.  After this target completes successfully, you should also run 
`make bundle` to update the latest production bundle with these new version
values.

## Cleaning Up

There may come a point at which you would like to remove old manager binaries,
dev kustomize overlays, and downloaded build tools to clear the way for new ones
to be written. This can be done by running the following target:

```sh
make clean
```
