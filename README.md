**[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/IBM/ibm-iam-operator)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/IBM/ibm-iam-operator)**


The `ibm-iam-operator` installs the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services Identity Management (IM) service. 

**Important:** Do not install this operator directly. Install this operator only by using the IBM Common Service Operator. For more information about installing the IBM Common Service Operator operator, see [Installer documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall) (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/kc_welcome_cs.html).

If you are using the operator as part of an IBM Cloud Pak, see the documentation for that IBM Cloud Pak to learn more about how to install and use the operator service. For more information about IBM Cloud Paks, see [IBM Cloud Paks that use Common Services](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_cloudpaks).

You can use the `ibm-iam-operator` to install the authentication and authorization services for the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services.

With these services, you can configure security for IBM Cloud Platform Common Services, IBM Certified Containers (IBM products), or IBM Cloud Paks that are installed.

For more information about the available IBM Cloud Platform Common Services, see the [IBM Knowledge Center](http://ibm.biz/cpcsdocs).

- If you are using the operator with an IBM Containerized Software, see the IBM Cloud Platform Common Services Knowledge Center [Installer documentation](http://ibm.biz/cpcs_opinstall).

## SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The IBM IM operator service supports running with the OpenShift Container Platform default restricted Security Context Constraints (SCCs).

For more information about the OpenShift Container Platform Security Context Constraints, see [Managing Security Context Constraints.](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html)

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

The IM operator does not define any specific pod security requirements.

## Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:

The IM operator does not define any specific custom pod security requirements.

## Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:

The IM operator runs under a restricted security context constraint with a non root uid.
