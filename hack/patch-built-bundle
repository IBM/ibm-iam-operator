# included in the examples beforehand. alm-examples is a JSON string, which makes it somewhat awkward to deal with in
# kustomize. Instead, use yq to get the Authentication CR example as a JSON file, merge that example with the
# OperandRequest and OperandBindInfo examples, and set alm-examples to that merged result.
